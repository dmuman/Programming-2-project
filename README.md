It is a project for the second semester at the uni.
Using Python (this time - OOP)- we have to make a program that would make appointments for doctors, depending on their availability, mothers' conditions etc. 
Made in collaboration with my dear friend and colleague: https://github.com/DFernadesA05
The project is not yet fully functioning.

To start the program from cmd: **python3 refresh.py inputFile1 inputFile2 inputFile3**
Where:
- **inputFile1** is a file with doctors.
- **inputFile2** is a file with schedules.
- **inputFile3** is a file with requests (mothers).

Test files are in the testSets folder
